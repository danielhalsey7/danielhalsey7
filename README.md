Aspiring Games Programmer
-------------------------

In 2018, I embarked on a journey into the world of coding, starting with self-teaching C# and Unity. What began as a personal exploration soon became a passion, fueled by the possibilities of game development and interactive design. Diving into C# and Unity was both challenging and exhilarating. I spent countless hours using online tutorials, reading documentation, and engaging in hands-on practice. I spend a great deal of time on Udemy learning to make a variety of game features and mechanics. The satisfaction of seeing my first game come to life was unparalleled, and this initial success ignited a deeper interest in programming. Driven by my newfound passion, I decided to formalize my education by pursuing a degree in Computer Programming at Edge Hill University. Upon completing my degree, I sought to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application. I secured a position as an apprentice programmer, where I shifted my focus to learning C++ and mastering Unreal Engine 4 and 5. This experience was invaluable, as it allowed me to work on complex projects, collaborate with experienced professionals, and deepen my understanding of game development and software engineering. Reflecting on my journey from a self-taught beginner to an apprentice programmer, I am proud of the progress I have made. Each step has reinforced my love for coding and my commitment to continuous learning. As I look to the future, I am excited to further develop my skills, tackle new challenges, and contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry.
